Preperation : 

  MAKING BHAJI : 
  
  Rinse, peel and chop the veggies. You will need 1 cup chopped cauliflower, 1 cup chopped carrot, 3 medium sized potatoes (chopped) and ⅓ cup chopped french beans. You can also add veggies of your choice.
  
  Add all the above chopped veggies in a 2 litre pressure cooker.
  Also add 1 cup green peas (fresh or frozen).Add to 2.5 cups water.

  Pressure cook the veggies for 5 to 6 whistles or for about 12 minutes on medium flame.
  When the pressure settles down on its own, open the cooker and check if the veggies are cooked well. 
  You can even steam or cook the veggies in a pan or pot. The vegetables have be to cooked completely. 
  Keep the vegetables along with the cooked water (stock) in the cooker itself.       

  Heat a pan or kadai. You can also use a large tawa. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons butter. 
  You can use amul butter or any brand of butter. Butter can be salted or unsalted.
  Let the butter melt. As soon as the butter melts, add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
  (jeera).Let the cumin seeds crackle and change their color.

  Then add ½ cup chopped onions. Mix onions with the butter and saute on a low to 
  medium flame till translucent. Saute till the onions turn translucent.

  Then add 2 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste. You can also crush or 1.5 inch ginger and 5 to 6 medium garlic cloves, crushed in a mortar-pestle. Mix and saute till the raw aroma of both ginger and garlic goes away.

  Then add 1 to 2 green chilies (chopped). Mix well. Now add 2 cups finely chopped tomatoes.
  Mix very well.Then begin to saute tomatoes on a low to medium flame.

  Saute till the tomatoes become soft and mushy and you see butter releasing from the sides. This takes about 6 to 7 minutes on a low to medium flame. If the tomatoes start sticking to the pan, then sprinkle some water and mix well.

  When the tomatoes have softened, then add ½ cup finely chopped capsicum (green bell pepper). Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. If the mixture starts sticking to the pan, then you can sprinkle some water. You don’t need to cook the capsicum till very soft. A little crunch is alright.

  Add 1 teaspoon turmeric powder and 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder.Then add 2 to 3 tablespoons Pav bhaji Masala Powder. Depending on how strong is the aroma and flavor of pav bhaji masala, you can add it less or more in the pav bhaji. Add 2 tablespoons if the pav bhaji masala is strong, intense and flavorful. For a less aromatic pav bhaji masala you can add 3 tablespoons of it.Mix very well.
 
  Add the cooked veggies.Mix well.Add all of the stock or water from the pressure cooker in which the veggies were cooked.Mix very well.Then season with salt as per taste.

  With a potato masher, begin to mash the veggies directly in the pan. With a potato masher, begin to mash the veggies directly in the pan.Keep on stirring occasionally and let the pav bhaji simmer for 8 to 10 minutes on a low flame.Keep on stirring occasionally and let the pav bhaji simmer for 8 to 10 minutes on a low flame.

  Keep on stirring occasionally and let the pav bhaji simmer for 8 to 10 minutes on a low flame.

  TOASTING PAV :

  when the bhaji is simmering, you can fry the pav so that you serve the pav with steaming hot bhaji. Slice the pavs from the center.Heat a tawa or a shallow frying pan. Keep the flame to a low and then add butter. When the butter begins to melt, add a bit of pav bhaji masala. You can skip pav bhaji masala if you want.Mix the pav bhaji masala very well with a spoon or spatula.Then place the pav on the butter.Rotate the pav all over the melted butter so that the pav absorbs the butter.

  Now turn over the pav and rotate them on the tawa so that the second side absorbs the butter. Add more butter if required. You can turn over and toast them more if required. Then remove it in a plate and keep aside. This way you can fry pav in two to three batches.

  SERVING THE PAV BHAJI

Now take the bhaji in a serving plate or a bowl.
Top it up with one to two cubes of butter. You can add more butter, if you like.
Place a side of finely chopped onions, lemon wedges and finely chopped coriander leaves. Or you can sprinkle onions, coriander leaves and lemon juice directly on the bhaji.
Serve bhaji with the lightly pan fried and buttered pav.
Pav bhaji is topped with chopped onions, coriander leaves and the lime or lemon juice is squeezed on the bhaji and then eaten with pav. you can check the video above to see how pav bhaji is served and eaten.
